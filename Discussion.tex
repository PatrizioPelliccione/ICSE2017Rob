%\pat{How much upfront? What are the key artifacts that should be maintained?}

{\bf Industry Perspective.} 
 To preserve an open approach to the project, a product manager at a software development company suggests a combination of an agile and fixed price contract by creating project branches to avoid overhead in the main project.

 {\bf Maturity.} The automotive software ecosystem needs to adapt to the needs from the stakeholders. The industry is not mature enough, but is improving to adopt cross-organisational Continuous Integration and Deployment.

\subsubsection{Cross-organisational transparency and CI\&D have an impact on business model strategies.}

The proposition challenges interviewees to critically evaluate the impact of cross-organisational transparency on the business model strategy of their organisation. They were asked about the impact on the business model strategy on a functional and organisational level. In general, the interviewees do not have an overview of the business model strategies of their organisation. Cross-organisational transparency and CI\&D had a bigger impact in the early stage of the project, but is getting less now the project is ongoing. The interviewees further state that CI\&D is not mature enough to have a big impact on business model strategies. 

However, the interview results support the proposition, and cross-organisational transparency and CI\&D could have an impact on business model strategies. %This answer to proposition 9 is deduced from the following findings:

\noindent {\bf Impact on organisational level.} The organisational impact is perceived differently by both companies. For Volvo, it is perceived as one of the many projects and because they do not have the integration and end-responsibility for the product, it has less of an impact. However, for Delphi, it is a high risk experiment due to the complexity of the project. Delphi employees confirm that it has the highest complexity level the company accepts.

\noindent {\bf Impact on functional level.} On functional level, the interviewees agree that the effects derived from the impact of cross-organisational transparency and CI\&D are gain in efficiency, quality and time-to-market. Also the continuous integration has less impact than intermittent integration, in case of big bang integration.

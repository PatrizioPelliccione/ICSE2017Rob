	Software Ecosystems},
  journal = {Requirements Engineering Journal (REEN)},
  year = {2016},
  abstract = {Software engineering practice has shifted from the development of
	products in closed environments towards more open and collaborative
	efforts. Software development has become significantly interdependent
	with other systems (e.g. services, apps) and typically takes place
	within large ecosystems of networked communities of stakeholder organizations.
	
	
	Such software ecosystems promise increased innovation power and support
	for consumer oriented software services at scale and are characterized
	by a certain openness of their information flows. 
	
	While such openness supports project and reputation management, it
	also brings requirements engineering-related challenges within the
	ecosystem, such as managing dynamic, emergent contributions from
	the ecosystem stakeholders, as well as collecting their input while
	protecting their IP.
	
	In this paper we report from a study of requirements communication
	and management practices within IBM(R)'s Collaborative Lifecycle
	Management(R)  product development ecosystem. Our research used multiple
	methods for data collection, including interviews within several
	ecosystem actors, on-site participatory observation, and  analysis
	of online project  repositories. We chart and describe the flow of
	product requirements information through the ecosystem, how the open
	communication paradigm in software ecosystems provides opportunities
	for 'just-in-time' RE - and which relies on emergent contributions
	from the ecosystem stakeholders-, as well as some of the challenges
	faced when traditional requirements engineering approaches are applied
	within such an ecosystem.
	
	More importantly, we discuss two tradeoffs brought about by the openness
	in software ecosystems: i) allowing open, transparent communication
	while keeping intellectual property confidential within the ecosystem,
	and ii) having the ability to act globally on a long-term strategy
	while empowering product teams to act locally to answer end-users'
	context specific needs in a timely manner.
	
	A sufficient level of openness facilitates contributions of emergent
	stakeholders. The ability to include important emergent contributors
	early in requirements elicitation appears to be a crucial asset in
	software ecosystems.},
